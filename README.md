# LemonCrimeFaceRig

Created by Eric  

Unity Build

Unity/Facerig/LemonCrimeFaceRig.exe

A unity file will open and a lemon crime should appear at the center of your screen.
Buttons should appear at the bottom hand screen.

PythonFiles\FaceLandMakerPythonServer\dist\FaceLandmarkServer\FaceLandmarkServer.exe

A command prompt should open
"Staring face detection"
then your webcam will turn on.
(this is the part that I am the most sacred of not working)


Once Both are open, you will have to calibrate face by clicking the button "calibrate all"
giving a full range of motion of...
eyelids
eye brows
mouth
crime

OBS

Create a game capture
choose the correct window
allow transparent - check
capture cursor - uncheck


Notes
The screen itself is not actually transparent for clicking.
Buttons may be a bit messed up for your monitor(see point below)
(I've done like zero serious qa on it so uhhh #yolo)
If you want anything tweek feel free to ask it nothing is too small


(PS there is an easter egg and the unity menu has to be the focus for it to work)
(PSS when you reach twitch partner, ill totally make some point commands for ya)
